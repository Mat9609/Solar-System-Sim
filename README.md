# Solar-System-Sim
It's simple simulation of Solar System. Calculations are based of gravitational force equation. It simulates planet movement. 
It enables panning with Left Mouse Button, zooming with mouse wheel.
By clicking Right Mouse Button and holding it, it is possible to draw comet vector. After realising RMB simulation of comet with given direction and speed in x and y will start.
